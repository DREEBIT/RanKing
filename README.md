RanKing is an MEAN.JS app that helps you to check your google keyword rankings. 

[![RanKing Screenshot](/_assets/Screenshot.png)](https://github.com/DREEBIT/RanKing)

## Features
* Manage a list of keywords
* RanKing uses the deprecated [Google Web-Search API](https://developers.google.com/web-search/docs/)
* Automatic fetch of 100 requests per day (as this is the limit of the API)
* View historic data and view top rankings of your keywords

## Prerequisites
This is an [MEAN.JS](http://meanjs.org/) application.
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install bower globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g bower
```

* Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install grunt globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```


## Running Your Application
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:

```
$ grunt
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it! Your application should be running. To proceed with your development, check the other sections in this documentation.
If you encounter any problems, try the Troubleshooting section.

* explore `config/env/development.js` for development environment configuration options

### Running in Production mode
To run your application with *production* environment configuration, execute grunt as follows:

```bash
$ grunt prod
```

* explore `config/env/production.js` for production environment configuration options

### Running with TLS (SSL)
Application will start by default with secure configuration (SSL mode) turned on and listen on port 8443.
To run your application in a secure manner you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates. Unix-based users can use the following command:

```bash
$ sh ./scripts/generate-ssl-certs.sh
```

Windows users can follow instructions found [here](http://www.websense.com/support/article/kbarticle/How-to-use-OpenSSL-and-Microsoft-Certification-Authority).
After you've generated the key and certificate, place them in the *config/sslcerts* folder.

Finally, execute grunt's prod task `grunt prod`
* enable/disable SSL mode in production environment change the `secure` option in `config/env/production.js`
